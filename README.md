## ü§î Challenges and Solutions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Size Inconsistencies
- **Problem**: Different sizes of images used in product cards negatively affected user experience.
- **Solution**: Applied `object-fit: cover;` and set fixed `height` values to crop images consistently.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Responsive Design Issues
- **Problem**: The category menu and product grid structure broke on mobile and tablet devices.
- **Solution**: Used media queries to adapt layouts for different screen sizes and integrated a hamburger menu.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Long Description Texts
- **Problem**: Product descriptions disrupted card sizes in some cases.
- **Solution**: Added the `text-overflow: ellipsis;` property to CSS and set fixed heights to prevent overflow.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Database Integration
- **Problem**: Errors occurred when inserting products into SQLite due to quotation marks.
- **Solution**: Used escape characters (`\`) to handle special characters in SQL queries.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Hover Zoom Effect Misalignment
- **Problem**: The zoom effect appeared misaligned on images of different sizes.
- **Solution**: Adjusted CSS to ensure images remained within the designated hover area.
